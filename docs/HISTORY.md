## 2026-02-16 — Execution Map Governance Formalized

- Formalized repository governance to treat `docs/executionMAP.md` as the canonical execution reference.
- Added mandatory pre-change execution-layer review requirement in `AGENTS.md`.
- Added synchronization rule requiring runtime changes to be reflected in both `docs/executionMAP.md` and `docs/HISTORY.md`.
- Added canonical execution map document structure and developer execution guide in `docs/executionMAP.md`.
- Runtime code unchanged.

## 2026-02 — Baseline Before Forced Visual Extraction

- Created baseline snapshot tag `baseline_pre_visual_extraction`.
- This tag captures state before implementing mandatory visual extraction in graph solves.
- Used to compare future accuracy experiments.
- No code changes were made.
